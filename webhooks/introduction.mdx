## Overview
Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about specific events in your application. They are a powerful way to integrate external systems with StableStack's API.


​
## How Webhooks Work
- Setup: Configure your webhook URL via the [dashboard](https://dashboard.stablestack.xyz).
- Event Trigger: When an event occurs (e.g., a payout is completed), Stablestack sends a POST request to your webhook URL.
- Response: Your server processes the request and responds with a 2xx status code to acknowledge receipt.
​
## Key Features
Real-time Notifications: Get notified instantly when events occur.
Customizable: Update your webhook URL or manage events as needed.
Secure: Webhooks include a signature secret for verification.
​
## Example Webhook Events
payout.initiated-transaction
payout.completed-transaction
payout.failed-transaction
payout.reversed-transaction
