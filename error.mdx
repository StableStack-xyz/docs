## API Error Handling

This document outlines the standard error responses and status codes used in the StableStack API. All error responses follow a consistent format to help you handle errors gracefully in your application.

## Error Response Format

All error responses follow this JSON structure:

```json
{
    "status":"failed",
    "message":"internal error",
    "error": {
        "code": "ERROR_CODE",
        "message": "Human readable error message",
        "details": {} // Optional additional error details
    }
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

### 4xx Client Errors

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 400 | Bad Request - The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Authentication is required or failed |
| 403 | Forbidden - The request was understood but refused |
| 404 | Not Found - The requested resource does not exist |
| 409 | Conflict - The request conflicts with the current state of the resource |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity - The request was well-formed but contained semantic errors |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |

### 5xx Server Errors

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 500 | Internal Server Error - An unexpected error occurred on the server |
| 502 | Bad Gateway - The server received an invalid response from an upstream server |
| 503 | Service Unavailable - The server is temporarily unable to handle the request |
| 504 | Gateway Timeout - The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server |

## Common Error Codes

### Authentication Errors (401)

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `INVALID_TOKEN` | The provided authentication token is invalid or expired |
| `MISSING_TOKEN` | No authentication token was provided |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | The provided credentials are incorrect |

### Validation Errors (400, 422)

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `INVALID_PARAMETER` | One or more request parameters are invalid |
| `MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD` | A required field is missing from the request |
| `INVALID_FORMAT` | The request data format is invalid |

### Resource Errors (404)

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` | The requested resource does not exist |
| `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND` | The requested API endpoint does not exist |

### Rate Limiting (429)

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many requests in a given time period |
| `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | API quota has been exceeded |

## Best Practices

1. **Always check the status code** first to determine if the request was successful
2. **Handle rate limiting** by implementing exponential backoff
3. **Log error details** for debugging purposes
4. **Implement retry logic** for 5xx errors


## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Rate limits are applied per API key and are reset every minute.

- Standard: 60 requests per minute

When rate limited, you'll receive a 429 status code with the following response:

```json
{
    "status":"failed",
    "message":"Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in 60 seconds.",
    "error": {
        "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
        "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in 60 seconds.",
        "details": {
        "retry_after": 60,
        "limit": 60,
        "remaining": 0
        }
    }
}
```
